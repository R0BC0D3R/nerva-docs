# NERVA Developer Guide

If you've never tried programming before, would you like to get your feet wet and start looking at code?  If you're a pro, would you like to help Nerva develop new things?  Here is how you can get started:

1. Find the project you'd like to contribute to in [Nerva Repository][nerva-project-github-link]
2. Go to that project and press "Fork" in the top right.  This will create your own copy of the project.
3. Once you're on your own copy of the project, create a branch for specific changes you'd like to make.
4. Use your favorite code editor or you can try [Visual Studio Code][visual-code-link] to check out your project, switch to the branch you just crated and start coding.
5. Once you're done, push your changes back to your brach of the project.
6. Go back to original Nerva project that you forked, click "Pull requests" and create new pull request linking your branch to original Nerva repository.
7. Finally, let us know on [Discord][nerva-discord-link] so somebody can review your changes and merge it to Nerva project.
