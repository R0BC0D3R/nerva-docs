# NERVA Documentation
The purpose of this documentation is to provide users with information about NERVA, easy to follow tutorials, and to help resolve common problems. Some additional developer-oriented documentation is available in the README files of individual repositories.

NERVA has both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI). Guides are available for both. Here's what you might be looking for:

* [More information about NERVA](about/)
* [NERVA Developer Guide](guides/develop/)
* [NERVA CLI Guide](guides/cli/) (with common issues & FAQ)
* [NERVA GUI Quick Guide](guides/gui/)
* [Ledger Hardware Wallet Guide](guides/ledger/)
* [Mining FAQ](guides/mining/)
* [A list of community projects](projects/)

If you can't find what you need with the search function, help is always available on [Discord][nerva-discord-link].

If you'd like to volunteer to help the NERVA project in another way - as a developer, tester, graphic designer, marketer or something completely different - join us on [Discord][nerva-discord-link] to see where your talents may be useful. NERVA is all about the community and the more it grows, the stronger we will become.
